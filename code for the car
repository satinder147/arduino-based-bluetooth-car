/*
 * THIS CODE IS FREE TO USE 
 Hello everybody this is the coed for my arduino based bluetooth robot 
 it is a very simple project and you can make it easily within a couple of hours if you are new to the arduino IDE
 the code although is self explanatory but i have commented it also so you can refer the comments as well


 the connections are as follows :
 vcc 5v on arduino                      ---> vcc on bluetooth module
 gnd(ground) on arduino                 ---> gnd on bluetooth module
 RX pin on arduino                      ---> TX pin on bluetooth module
 TX pin on arduino                      ---> RX pin on bluetooth module
 digital pin 8,12,6,4,7,5 on arduino    ---> 8,12,6,4,7,5 on motor shield
 vcc 5v from arduino                    ---> 5v on motor shield
 gnd from arduino                       ---> gnd on motor shield
 vin from arduino                       ---> vin on motor shield

 for the video and making tutorial you can watch this video on the youtube channel 'reactor science' (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVu2Ie45Bh89lpdg7ezdMyg)

                     *********     VERY IMPORTANT     **********
      ***** REMOVE THE TX AND RX PIN FROM ARDUINO BEFORE UPLOADING THE CODE   ******
